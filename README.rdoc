== recipefinder

Created for the course {Ruby on Rails: An Introduction}[https://www.coursera.org/learn/ruby-on-rails-intro/home/welcome].

This is a simple Rails app that queries the Food2Fork API and returns a list of recipes based on a search parameter. The results are displayed in a table for the user.

A live version can be viewed on Heroku:
